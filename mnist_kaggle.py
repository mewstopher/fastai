# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("/USERS/brendenleavitt/documents/code/digit_recog/"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

learn.unfreeze()


#  The earlier layers (as we've seen) have more general-purpose features. Therefore we would expect them to need less fine-tuning for new datasets. For this reason we will use different learning rates for different layers: the first few layers will be at 1e-4, the middle layers at 1e-3, and our FC layers we'll leave at 1e-2 as before. We refer to this as differential learning rates,
